**Spliit Cloud is a community-maintained fork of Spliit: a free, open-source expense splitting app for groups, trips, roommates, friends, and shared costs.**

It keeps the simplicity of the original Spliit while moving toward cloud accounts, reliable group syncing, stronger tests, and a more maintainable stack.

## What is Spliit Cloud?

Spliit Cloud is a community-maintained fork of [Spliit](https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit), the open-source expense splitter originally created by [Sebastien Castiel](https://github.com/scastiel). It aims to keep the lightweight, no-frills experience that made Spliit popular while evolving the product toward real cloud accounts, reliable multi-device sync, and a stack that is easier to operate and self-host.

The public instance lives at [spliit.cloud](https://spliit.cloud): the web app runs on Cloudflare Pages, the API runs on a Hetzner VPS via Dokploy with PostgreSQL on the same VPS, database backups are written to a dedicated Cloudflare R2 bucket, and asset uploads are stored in a separate Cloudflare R2 bucket.

## Why this fork exists

Spliit Cloud exists because I liked Spliit and wanted to keep using it with my friends.

The original Spliit project, created by [Sebastien Castiel](https://github.com/scastiel), is a clean and useful open-source alternative to Splitwise. I first looked at contributing improvements upstream, but after submitting fixes and reviewing existing issues and pull requests, the project appeared to have slowed down.

This fork is meant to continue that work openly, with proper credit to the original author and project.

The main things I wanted to improve are:

- authenticated accounts, including an email-free and social-free anonymous option
- reliable group syncing across devices and users
- account-bound groups (no more local-only groups identified only by a URL)
- a stronger test suite
- a lighter and easier-to-operate stack
- clearer self-hosting and deployment paths
- migration/import support for existing Spliit groups

Spliit Cloud ships only account-bound groups. I explored supporting both local and synced groups in [spliit-app/spliit#495](https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit/pull/495), but the dual model became hard to implement and hard to explain. Binding groups to accounts keeps the mental model simple, the data secure, and every action attributable to a member. You do not have to use email or social login: an anonymous account type exists for people who want that privacy, while still giving the group clear authorization and responsibility for what each member does. See the [FAQ](#do-i-need-email-or-social-login) for the full reasoning.

Spliit Cloud is not affiliated with the original Spliit project unless stated otherwise.

## Relationship to Spliit

Spliit Cloud is a community fork of [spliit-app/spliit](https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit).

Credit for the original idea, design, and foundation belongs to the original Spliit project and its creator, [Sebastien Castiel](https://github.com/scastiel).

This fork keeps the project open-source and aims to continue development in a direction focused on accounts, syncing, maintainability, and self-hosting.

The original `spliit-app/spliit` project appears to have slowed down, with many issues and pull requests not receiving maintainer responses recently. This fork exists to keep the project moving in a more focused direction while preserving credit to the original work.

## Who is this for?

Spliit Cloud may be useful if you want:

- a free and open-source alternative to Splitwise
- shared expense tracking for trips, friends, roommates, couples, or small groups
- a hosted app with synced groups and accounts, including anonymous accounts that do not require email or social login
- a self-hostable expense splitting app
- a project that is actively maintained and open to contributions
- a codebase with stronger tests and a simpler operating model

## Roadmap

The [detailed roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) is the source of truth. Current work focuses on privacy/trust features (end-to-end encryption and offline support), expanded integrations, and self-hosting polish.

## Known limitations

Spliit Cloud is still evolving. Current limitations may include:

- offline-first usage is not complete yet
- end-to-end encryption is planned but not available yet

Please open an issue if you hit a bug or if a missing feature blocks your usage.

## Data and privacy

Spliit Cloud stores expense data needed to make the app work, including groups, participants, expenses, balances, and uploaded expense documents if that feature is enabled.

The public instance is hosted as follows:

- web app: Cloudflare Pages
- API: Hetzner VPS via Dokploy
- database: PostgreSQL
- database backups: Cloudflare R2
- uploaded assets: Cloudflare R2

For users who want full control over data and infrastructure, self-hosting is supported. See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) for the detailed data-handling notes and [Self-hosting overview](#self-hosting-overview) for running your own instance.

## Security

If you discover a security issue, please follow the responsible disclosure process in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.

## Self-hosting overview

Spliit Cloud deploys as a single [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) project: the
web app builds as a static SPA and the API runs as one Node.js serverless
function behind the same domain, so no separate host or reverse proxy is
needed. Recurring-expense processing (and, if enabled, anonymous-account
cleanup) runs via Vercel Cron instead of an always-on background worker. Any
Postgres works ([Neon](https://neon.tech/) is a good managed fit); any
S3-compatible bucket works for document storage ([Cloudflare
R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) is a good fit).

SMTP is required for sign-in links, email verification, recovery, and
invitations. S3-compatible document storage, AI features, OAuth providers, Web
Push, and the MCP assistant are optional.

The MCP assistant server still deploys separately as a small always-on
service (Docker image, e.g. via Dokploy) — see
[docs/mcp-publishing.md](./docs/mcp-publishing.md).

## Run locally

1. Clone the repository (or your fork if you intend to contribute).
2. Run `bun install` to install dependencies.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`).
4. Start local services, run Prisma operations, and start the app servers:

   ```bash
   bun dev:up                       # postgres, maxio, maildev via compose.dev.yaml
   bun prisma-migrate
   bun dev                          # web on :3000, api on :3001
   ```

   `bun dev:down` stops the local service containers. Remove `storage/` for a
   clean reset of all local service state.

Local services exposed by `bun dev:up`:

- PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432`
- MaxIO object storage at http://localhost:9000/ui/
- MailDev email inbox at http://localhost:1080

State for the local services lives under `storage/` at the repo root. The
MaxIO bucket CORS/public-read config lives at
`storage/maxio/buckets/spliit-local/.bucket.json`; other local service state is
ignored by Git.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Import this repository into a new Vercel project. Root Directory: `.`
   (repo root) — the build needs the whole Bun workspace to resolve
   `@spliit/*` packages and produce both the SPA build and the API function.
2. Provision Postgres (e.g. a [Neon](https://neon.tech/) database) and an
   S3-compatible bucket for document storage (e.g. [Cloudflare
   R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), region `auto`).
3. Run migrations once against that database before the first deploy:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=<your-connection-string> bun run prisma-migrate
   ```

   Vercel's build does **not** run migrations automatically (builds run per
   deployment, including preview branches, so coupling `prisma migrate
deploy` to every build risks concurrent/duplicate runs against a single
   database). Re-run this manually whenever a deploy includes a schema
   change.

4. Set these Vercel project environment variables (see `.env.example` for
   the full list and descriptions):

   - `DATABASE_URL`, `S3_UPLOAD_*`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -base64 32`)
   - `WEB_ORIGINS` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` set to your Vercel domain (same
     origin for both, since web and API share one deployment)
   - `TRUST_PROXY=true` (Vercel's edge is the sole ingress and reliably sets
     `X-Forwarded-For`)
   - `CRON_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`) — authenticates Vercel's own
     requests to `/api/cron/*`
   - SMTP settings, `EMAIL_FROM`, and `EMAIL_UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET`
   - for a private instance, `SIGNUP_MODE=invite_only` so only invited
     people can create accounts (the first user on a fresh instance can
     always register)

5. Deploy. `vercel.json` at the repo root configures the build, the API
   function, the SPA fallback routing, and the three Vercel Cron jobs that
   replace the old background worker (recurring-expense materialize every 5
   minutes, reconcile every 30 minutes, anonymous-account cleanup daily).

Notification delivery (email/push activity alerts and budget-threshold
alerts) is currently disabled in this deployment path — the underlying
tables and enqueue calls still exist, but nothing drains those queues.
Everything else (auth email, invitations, recurring expenses, exports,
imports, AI features) works the same as self-hosted.

## Health check

The application has a health check endpoint that can be used to check if the application is running and if the database is accessible.

- `GET /health/readiness` or `GET /health` - Check if the API is ready to serve requests, including database connectivity.
- `GET /health/liveness` - Check if the API process is running, but not necessarily ready to serve requests.

## Opt-in features

### Expense documents

Spliit Cloud offers users to upload images (to an AWS S3 bucket) and attach them to expenses. To enable this feature:

- Create and configure an S3-compatible bucket where images will be stored.
- Update your environments variables with appropriate values:

```.env
PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPENSE_DOCUMENTS=true
S3_UPLOAD_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET=name-of-s3-bucket
S3_UPLOAD_REGION=us-east-1
S3_UPLOAD_PUBLIC_URL=https://uploads.example.com
```

You can also use other S3 providers by providing a custom endpoint:

```.env
S3_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
```

`S3_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT` is used for signing uploads. `S3_UPLOAD_PUBLIC_URL` is an
optional browser-readable base URL stored on expense documents and must serve
objects by key, for example `https://uploads.example.com/document-...jpg`. If it
is not configured, documents use the default AWS S3 public URL format.

Configure an object lifecycle rule for the `tmp/imports/` prefix with a
one-day expiration. The import flow deletes its temporary copies after a
successful database commit, while the lifecycle rule cleans up abandoned or
interrupted imports.

### Create expense from receipt

You can offer users to create expense by uploading a receipt. This feature relies on an AI provider and a public S3 storage endpoint.

To enable the feature:

- You must enable expense documents feature as well (see section above). That might change in the future, but for now we need to store images to make receipt scanning work.
- Subscribe to an AI provider and get an API key.
- Update your environment variables with appropriate values:

```.env
PUBLIC_ENABLE_RECEIPT_EXTRACT=true
AI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

The model used for receipt extraction defaults to `gpt-5-nano`. Override it with `AI_RECEIPT_MODEL`.

### Deduce category from title

You can offer users to automatically deduce the expense category from the title. This feature relies on an AI provider; follow the signup instructions above and configure the following environment variables:

```.env
PUBLIC_ENABLE_CATEGORY_EXTRACT=true
AI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

The model used for category extraction defaults to `gpt-5-nano`. Override it with `AI_CATEGORY_MODEL`.

### Choosing an AI provider

Set `AI_PROVIDER` to select the request protocol. Provider selection is explicit and is never inferred from a model ID:

```.env
AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
AI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
AI_RECEIPT_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
AI_CATEGORY_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

Supported providers are `openai` (Responses API), `anthropic` (Messages API), `openai-compatible` (Chat Completions API), and `google` (Gemini API). `AI_BASE_URL` is optional and must be the API root; the selected SDK adapter appends its endpoint path.

## Stack

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) for the web SPA, replacing Next.js in favor of simplicity, efficiency, and room for future expansion
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) + [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) for the API, also chosen over Next.js API routes for a smaller and more explicit runtime
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for package management and the API runtime
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling
- [shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI components
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) to access the database

## Import and export

Spliit Cloud can import and export group and account data so you keep ownership of it.

Import:

- original Spliit (`spliit.app` and self-hosted) group exports, including documents
- Splitwise CSV
- Spliit Cloud group, account, and friend-ledger bundles

Export:

- CSV
- printable / PDF expense reports
- Spliit Cloud group ZIP bundles, including documents
- full account bundles

See [docs/migration.md](./docs/migration.md) for the step-by-step migration guide from original Spliit.

## Contributing

The project is open to contributions. Feel free to open an issue or even a pull request!

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the workflow, local setup, and PR expectations.

Financial support links are TBD. See [Support the project](#support-the-project) for non-financial ways to help.

### Development principles

- Keep the stack small and explicit. Vite + React on the web, Hono + tRPC on the API, PostgreSQL via Prisma.
- Validate at the boundary with Zod, keep tRPC procedures thin, and put real business logic in shared domain or API helpers.
- Treat the schema, migrations, and generated Prisma client as a single unit — commit them together.
- Comments explain _why_, not _what_. When in doubt, drop the comment.
- Money is stored as integer cents; percentage shares use basis points.

### Correctness

- Unit tests live next to the code they cover and run with `bun run test`.
- Critical flows (balances, splits, recurrence, currency conversion) are expected to have tests before they ship.
- Formatting, linting, and TypeScript checks are enforced with `bun run check`; CI should not be the first place a static error surfaces.

## FAQ

### Is Spliit Cloud affiliated with the original Spliit project?

No. Spliit Cloud is an independent community fork of Spliit. The original Spliit project was created by Sebastien Castiel.

### Why not just contribute to the original project?

That was the original intention. After submitting fixes and reviewing existing issues and pull requests, the original project appeared to have slowed down. This fork allows development to continue while keeping the work open-source and properly attributed.

### Is Spliit Cloud free?

The code is open-source under the MIT license. The public hosted instance is currently provided as a community service. Long-term hosting/support details may evolve.

### Can I self-host it?

Yes. Self-hosting is supported. See the local and container setup instructions below.

### Can I migrate from original Spliit?

Yes. Import of `spliit.app` group exports is supported today; see [docs/migration.md](./docs/migration.md) for the step-by-step. Self-hosted Spliit instances can be migrated by exporting each group and importing it into Spliit Cloud. Splitwise CSV and Spliit Cloud bundles (groups, accounts, and friend ledgers) can be imported the same way.

You can also export Spliit Cloud data as CSV, printable PDF reports, and ZIP bundles that include documents.

### Do I need email or social login?

No. Groups in Spliit Cloud are always bound to an account so membership, edits, and responsibility stay clear, but that account does not have to be tied to email or a social provider.

You can create an **anonymous account**: no email address, no Google/GitHub/OIDC. You keep a recovery link instead. The group still sees a real member with authorization, so actions are attributable instead of living behind a shared URL that anyone can edit.

That is different from original Spliit's local-only groups, which lived entirely in the browser and were identified by a URL or group ID. In practice that led to:

- **Confusion**: friends and family who tried the app weren't sure how local groups worked, who could edit what, or where the data lived.
- **Data loss**: clearing site data, switching browsers, or reinstalling silently remove the group from their "account".
- **Lost access**: lose the link and the group is gone.
- **Weak security**: anyone who stumbled on a group ID had full edit access, and even trusted participants could make a mistaken or bad-faith edit with no real recourse.

I tried supporting both local and synced groups in [spliit-app/spliit#495](https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit/pull/495), but the dual model became too complex to build and too complex to explain. Account-bound groups give Spliit Cloud a simpler mental model, real ownership, easier collaboration, and a foundation for features like member management and notifications. Local-only groups are probably not coming back. Anonymous accounts are the way to keep that authorization model without forcing people onto email or social login.

### Is my data end-to-end encrypted?

Not yet. End-to-end encrypted groups and expenses are on the roadmap.

### Can I contribute?

Yes. Issues, bug reports, tests, documentation, translations, and pull requests are welcome.

## Support the project

For now, the best ways to support Spliit Cloud are:

- star the repository
- try the app and report bugs
- improve documentation
- contribute tests
- help with translations
- share feedback from real usage

## Providers & supporters

Spliit Cloud relies on a small set of external services for features that are impractical to run entirely in-house (exchange rates, email delivery, AI inference, and similar). This section credits the providers we use today and lists openings where we are looking for partners who can offer sustainable free or sponsored capacity for the public instance.

If you run a service that could help and are willing to support Spliit Cloud, email **[contact@spliit.cloud](mailto:contact@spliit.cloud)**.
